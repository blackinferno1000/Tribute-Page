    <p>As a child, Izuku greatly admired heroes. He wished to be a hero like his idol All Might once he got his Quirk. By the time children his age manifested their powers, however, Izuku still showed no signs of developing any special abilities. Due to that, his mother took him to a doctor from whom he received the fact that he has two joints on his pinky toe. He would never have a Quirk. Later on that same day, Izuku kept watching videos of All Might on his computer and tearfully asked his mother if he could still become a hero. She hugged him and apologized, words that Izuku would remember as not what he wanted to hear.</p>
    <p>
Even so, Izuku kept aiming to be a hero and to get into U.A. High. That led him to be constantly bullied and ridiculed by his childhood friend, Katsuki Bakugo, and his classmates, who believed it was impossible for someone without a Quirk to ever become a hero.</p>

Izuku is attending class at Orudera Junior High School while his teacher announces that all students will graduate this year. A student, Katsuki Bakugo, replies that he's not like the other class members, calling them all fodder and that only he is destined to attend U.A., and he alone will surpass All Might. Once his teacher announces Izuku is attempting to get into U.A. as well, Katsuki is shocked and furious. He berates Izuku and uses an Explosion quirk to scare him, claiming that someone who is quirkless cannot get into U.A. and can't do anything at all.

    <p>
The same day, while walking home, a villain fleeing the scene of a crime encounters Izuku. The villain had apparently escaped All Might earlier in the day. The villain decided that to avoid detection, he should take over Izuku's body. Just as Izuku fell into despair, All Might showed up and saved him. Stunned, Izuku asked for an autograph, but All Might left before he could ask the questions he had on his mind. In an effort to get All Might to stay, he latched on to All Might's leg and hanged on while he launched himself into the air. After a quick struggle they landed safely on a rooftop. Where Izuku asked if he could become a hero without an individuality. Telling All Might that he always wanted to be a hero and save people.
Suddenly All Might's appearance drastically changes to a more skeletic form. All Might reveals to the young man that he was injured in battle five years ago and can only stay in his hero form for a short time. He goes on to tell Izuku that professionals must always put their lives at stake to save the day and thus cannot openly say whether it is possible to be a Hero without a Quirk as it may not be possible. All Might says that if Izuku cares about saving people, he can always go on to become a policeman, as in that way he can be responsible for putting the villains in jail (even though it is ridiculed). He tells Izuku that it is not bad to dream, but warns him not to obscure the facts and then leaves.

Sludge villain attacks Midoriya
Izuku confronts the Sludge Villain.

Frustrated with the words of his idol, Izuku starts reconsidering his dream of becoming a hero. His thoughts are interrupted as he gets near the scene of a villain attack. Izuku recognizes Katsuki as the victim being possessed by the Sludge Villain that had attacked him earlier and feels guilty that he might have accidentally let the villain escape from All Might's possession. Izuku, having looked at katsuki's pleading eyes, rushes towards the villain, attempting to save Katsuki despite his Quirklessness. As the Sludge Villain prepares to attack Izuku, All Might, inspired by the boy's action, shows up and defeats the villain before Izuku could get hurt.
The Pro Heroes at the scene started berating Izuku for his reckless behavior. Katsuki became mad that he was saved from Izuku, telling him that he wasn't saved by him at all and walking away. All Might appeared and thanked Midoriya for reminding him what it means to be a hero and then explained that what he did was what most top heroes did in their younger days, this made him tell Izuku that he can become a hero as he offered him the chance to become one.

Izuku Training At Dagobah Park
Izuku training to become a vessel for One For All.

All Might tells Izuku he's worthy to inherit his strength and that he has the power to transfer his Quirk to people. All Might then begins to train him at the Seaside Park by moving large pieces of garbage around, such as trucks, large office drawers, various craters, and bookshelves. After 10 months of training, the day of the entrance exam arrives. At six o'clock in the morning, at the last possible second, Izuku moves the final piece of garbage. All Might commends him and cuts off a piece of his hair and gives it to Izuku, who eats it, receiving his first dose, a very small piece of One For All.
